Turkish Makam Music Symbolic Data Collection

Given the lack of machine readable symbolic data to perform computational studies of Turkish Makam music, we have put together a collection of machine readable symbolic scores, SymbTr, which contains data in text, PDF and MIDI formats. This is raw data drawn from reliable sources that consists of musical pieces from Turkish art and folk music. Special care has been taken to select works covering a broad historical time span while being works that are still performed today.

Please cite the following publication if you use the dataset in your work:
KaraosmanoÄŸlu, M. K. (2012). A Turkish makam music symbolic database for music information retrieval: SymbTr. Proc. Int. Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR).

Contains:
- The SymbTr v1.0.0. This is the first version of the SymbTr collection originally explained in (Karaosmaoglu, 2012) (~1700 pieces). This version is kept for documentation and research reproducibility purposes. Please download the latest release for the up-to-date data collection.

### Where are the PDFs?

Adding the PDFs to the repository would make it fairly bulky. You can download the PDFs from the CompMusic website (http://compmusic.upf.edu/node/140). You can also follow the link in the corresponding /PDF folder to download the files.
